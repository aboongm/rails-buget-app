# Rails Budget App

The Ruby on Rails capstone project builds a mobile web application where I can manage my budget: I have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that I can see how much money I spent and on what.

I created a Ruby on Rails application that allowed the user to:

- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- Create categories and add expenses on each of these categories
- see the expenses on each category.
