# Rails Budget App

The Ruby on Rails capstone project is to build a mobile web application where I can manage my budget: I have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that I can see how much money I spent and on what.

I will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

    - register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
    - introduce new transactions associated with a category.
    - see the money spent on each category.
